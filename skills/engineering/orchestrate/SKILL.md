description: Coordinate non-trivial engineering work with bounded native subagents when independent execution, difficult diagnosis, current research, or an independent review materially helps. Use the active harness's own subagent and model mechanisms only; keep small, local, readily verifiable work with the root agent.

# Orchestrate

Use this skill as a thin coordinator. The root agent owns the user's outcome, architecture, decomposition, dependency decisions, integration, and final acceptance. Workers supply bounded evidence or edits; they do not replace root ownership.

## 1. Pin the run

Record the outcome, exclusions, acceptance checks, current revision and dirty baseline, authorized tools, and the active harness. Load exactly one host reference when the harness is known:

- Claude Code: read [references/claude-code.md](references/claude-code.md).
- Codex: read [references/codex.md](references/codex.md).
- A host that cannot be identified or has no native subagent capability: continue root-only for independent safe preparation, but if the user or repository rules require delegation, report the capability gap rather than claiming independence.

Treat the host's native tool schema, configured roles, model catalog, permission boundaries, and role locks as the source of truth. Prefer the bundled `orchestrate-*` roles when exposed and compatible with the contract; explicit user or repository role preferences win. When installation or configuration is requested, read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md). Skill discovery alone does not prove agent registration. This step is complete when the target, authority, baseline, host, and acceptance checks are explicit.

## 2. Choose the route

Read [references/routing.md](references/routing.md) when deciding whether to delegate or which role/model tier to request.

Keep the work root-only when it is small, localized, and readily checked in the current context. Delegate when there is an independent bounded slice, useful parallel work, difficult diagnosis or research, a material independent review, or an explicit request for agents. Split by observable outcome and dependency; keep shared contracts and architecture decisions with the root. This step is complete when the route is `root-only` or a list of ready slices with dependencies and ownership.

## 3. Dispatch real bounded work

For a delegated route, call the active harness's native spawn/subagent tool before performing that slice in the root. A plan, a simulated transcript, or a worker-like narration is not a spawn. Dispatch independent ready slices together; serialize dependent slices. Start with a small fan-out and expand only when ownership and verification remain clear.

Give every worker a contract containing:

```text
Task ID and one objective:
Inputs and evidence:
Applicable skills: exposed identifiers or exact SKILL.md paths; required versus optional:
Files/subsystem owned; files that must not change:
Prerequisites:
Expected artifact and acceptance criteria:
Role, requested model and effort when the native schema supports them:
Inherited tools/permissions:
Retry bound, return condition, and escalation path:
```

Use the least expensive configured role/model that can satisfy the acceptance checks; choose a stronger configured tier for ambiguity, high-impact changes, or independent review. Preserve the root's selected model and existing role/profile preferences. Honor locked roles and native schema validation. If the requested capability is unavailable, do not invent a successful dispatch, silently switch harnesses, edit user configuration, or relabel another model as the requested one. Continue only safe preparatory work and report the exact gap, unless an authorized supported fallback meets the user's qualitative requirement.

Resolve the role's applicable skills before dispatch: reviewer uses `code-review` and `coding-standards` for convention checks; worker uses `implement` and applicable `coding-standards`; tester uses `verification-before-completion`, adding `tdd` for assigned TDD work; researcher uses `research`; explorer loads only task-relevant assigned skills. Pass their actual catalog identifiers or exact readable paths, including plugin namespaces when exposed. The worker loads them before work and reports loaded or missing skills; parent context is not proof of inheritance. If a default is absent, disclose the gap and use the bounded role workflow. An explicitly required missing skill blocks dependent work. Skill instructions do not expand the assignment's permissions, ownership, or delegation authority; the root handles steps outside those boundaries.

This step is complete when each selected delegated slice has a successful native dispatch record, or the route is honestly marked blocked/failed with no claim that delegation occurred.

## 4. Supervise ownership and recovery

Keep one active writer per file or subsystem. An exception requires an explicit root decision proving disjoint ownership and a check that the shared contract is settled. Read [references/recovery.md](references/recovery.md) for timeouts, failed workers, stale results, and replacement.

Before replacing a writer, obtain native evidence that it terminated or can no longer write; a timeout or silence is not termination. Inspect and preserve its partial diff and the original dirty baseline, then record an explicit ownership transfer. Retry once with a narrower contract. Escalate one supported native tier only when capability, rather than missing information, is the blocker; after another failure, reassess at the root. This step is complete when every worker is completed, blocked, failed, or cancelled and no required writer remains unknown or active.

## 5. Integrate through existing owners

Use existing skills for their established work: `planning-and-task-breakdown` for slicing, `implement` for bounded changes, `diagnosing-bugs` for evidence before a fix, `code-review` for independent findings, `verification-before-completion` for acceptance, and `git-workflow` for checkout/commit mechanics. If one is unavailable, perform only its equivalent scoped checks inline; the orchestrator must remain independently usable.

The root resolves conflicting findings, applies or accepts changes within the owned scope, and reruns checks after the latest integrated edit. Do not let workers recursively create an unbounded team or silently expand their scope. This step is complete when the integrated diff is understood, ownership conflicts are resolved, and the intended artifacts are present.

## 6. Verify and report

Verify the acceptance criteria against the integrated state, using the smallest reliable checks and an independent review when risk warrants it. Run checks and review against the latest integrated diff; a review from before the last edit is stale. Confirm that required native workers have finished, inspect the final diff for unrelated changes, and distinguish requested/configured model from observed model identity. A worker's confidence, “done” message, or stale test result is not acceptance.

Report the route, actual native dispatches and statuses, owned artifacts, commands and observed results, model identity only when exposed, unresolved risks, and any capability gap. Completion means the root has accepted the verified result. If the workflow stops because a required capability, artifact, check, or ownership state is missing, report `blocked` or `failed` with the exact next decision; that terminal workflow state is not a claim that the user's goal was achieved.
