# PR description

`pr-description` writes pull request titles and bodies from the final diff. It is
model-invoked and can also be requested directly.

Try: “Write the PR description for this branch,” “Rewrite PR 88's title and body
to match what it does now,” or “Draft the PR text before I publish.” A text-only
request returns the title and body without touching Git or the forge.

The skill reads the project's title rules and PR template, inspects the full
merge-base diff (locally or through the forge's diff API), and writes for the
reviewer. Titles describe the final outcome. Bodies are brief and use the
project's domain language:

- **Summary:** what changes and why, with the smallest visual that makes the
  point when the change has a shape (pseudocode, a call, component, or file
  tree, a Mermaid diagram, or a diff sketch).
- **Evidence:** before and after: screenshots for a visual change, otherwise the
  exact test or command that failed and now passes. Unrun checks are named.
- **Review notes**, when needed: decisions the diff cannot explain, and rollout
  or compatibility implications.
- **Merge danger:** whether the change is a one-way or two-way door, and its
  blast radius: what breaks, for whom, if it is wrong.

Required
project templates and naming conventions remain authoritative. PRs credit the
human author only; agent "Generated with" footers are left out unless a
repository policy requires AI-use disclosure.

When creating or updating a PR is authorized, it passes the body through a UTF-8
file and re-reads the saved metadata. Branches, commits, and pushes belong to
[git-workflow](git-workflow.md); CI repair, review follow-up, and merging belong
to [babysit-pr](babysit-pr.md).

## Design and evidence

This skill was split out of `git-workflow` so PR-writing requests trigger on
their own; the [split record](../research/2026-10-09-git-workflow-split.md)
explains the boundary. The writing guidance comes from the
[git-workflow research](../research/2026-09-26-git-workflow.md): EveryInc informed
outcome-led PR writing, and Cursor pstack and Matt Pocock informed review context
and evidence. The merge-danger section follows Matt Pocock's `pr` skill, first
recorded in the [2026-09 source sweep](../research/2026-09-27-source-repos-sweep.md).
The summary visuals, before/after evidence, and structured merge danger were
adopted from the same skill, whose visual menu comes from Dex Horthy's `show-me`;
the [adoption record](../research/2026-10-09-pr-description-pocock.md) lists
what was taken and what was not.
