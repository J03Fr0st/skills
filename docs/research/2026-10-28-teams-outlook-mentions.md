# How Teams and Outlook encode @mentions

Research for the `writing-for-humans` message layout, which asks the greeting
to @mention the person who acts (PR J03Fr0st/skills#71). The question: what
markup or metadata makes a real mention, one that notifies the person, in
Microsoft Teams and Outlook email?

## Conclusion

Teams and Outlook work differently.

- **Teams:** a mention is inline markup plus a matching metadata entry. The
  text alone notifies no one.
- **Outlook:** a mention is message metadata, not body markup. Typing `@Name`
  in Outlook makes the client set it. No HTML a writer can paste is documented
  to produce a real mention.

The skill's current email rule, `<a href="mailto:ADDRESS">@Display Name</a>`,
therefore produces a link, not a mention. Its Teams rule is correct for Graph
`chatMessage`, but it needs the ID type stated and does not cover Adaptive
Cards sent by bots or incoming webhooks.

## Teams

### Graph chatMessage (send as a user)

First-party documentation. The `chatMessage` body must be HTML. Each mention is
an `at` element whose `id` matches an entry in the message's `mentions` array:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "contentType": "html",
    "content": "Hello World <at id=\"0\">Jane Smith</at>"
  },
  "mentions": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "mentionText": "Jane Smith",
      "mentioned": {
        "user": {
          "displayName": "Jane Smith",
          "id": "ef1c916a-3135-4417-ba27-8eb7bd084193",
          "userIdentityType": "aadUser"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `chatMessageMention` reference states that `id` "matches the {index}
value in the corresponding `<at id="{index}">` tag", and that the body
"encloses the **mentionText** of each mention in an HTML `at` element". The
documented `mentioned.user.id` is the Microsoft Entra object ID with
`userIdentityType` `aadUser`. The Graph pages show no example using a UPN
or email address for this ID.

### Adaptive Cards (bots and incoming webhooks)

First-party documentation. The card text uses `<at>Name</at>` with no `id`
attribute, and `msteams.entities` carries a `mention` whose `text` repeats the
same `<at>` string:

```json
"msteams": {
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "mention",
      "text": "<at>Adele Vance</at>",
      "mentioned": { "id": "AdeleV@contoso.onmicrosoft.com", "name": "Adele Vance" }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Bots accept the Teams user ID (`29:…`), the Entra object ID, or the UPN.
- Incoming webhooks accept the Entra object ID or the UPN, support only user
  mentions, and cap the card at 28 KB.
- Mentions work in `TextBlock` and `FactSet` elements.
- Channel and team mentions aren't supported in bot messages.

## Outlook email

### What a real mention is

The Outlook support article says that typing @ and a name will "highlight
their name and prompt Outlook to add them to the To line". The recipient sees
an @ marker in the Inbox and can filter for mail that mentions them. The
"Mentioned" filter needs Exchange Server 2016 or later, Exchange Online, or
Outlook.com. The @ indicator needs Exchange Online or Outlook.com.

The Graph beta `mention` resource explains the mechanism: Outlook "sets the
**mentions** property before it creates and sends the message". A mention is
therefore metadata on the message. Its `mentionText` is "not used and
defaulted as null for **message**".

### Sending one through Graph

Beta only. `sendMail` and draft creation accept a `mentions` array alongside
the required `toRecipients`. The documented example has no special body
markup:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "subject": "Project kickoff",
    "toRecipients": [{ "emailAddress": { "name": "Samantha Booth", "address": "samanthab@contoso.com" } }],
    "mentions": [{ "mentioned": { "name": "Dana Swope", "address": "danas@contoso.com" } }]
  }
}
```

The beta pages warn that `/beta` APIs "are subject to change" and that
production use "is not supported". I found no v1.0 equivalent.

### Hand-written HTML

Community report, unverified. A 2022 forum thread, building on a 2019 Stack
Overflow answer, adds `<a id="OWAAM<guid>" href="mailto:…">@Name</a>` to the
HTML body. The original poster reports that this produces only a named link:
there is no @ indicator, and the mail does not appear under the "Mentioned"
filter. No Microsoft source documents an `OWAAM` anchor.

## Implications for writing-for-humans

These are inferences from the evidence above.

1. **Teams via Graph:** keep `<at id="N">Display Name</at>` with a matching
   `mentions[N]`. Require `mentionText` to equal the text inside the `at`
   element, `mentioned.user.id` to be the Entra object ID, and
   `userIdentityType` to be `aadUser`.
2. **Teams via an Adaptive Card** (bot or incoming webhook): use
   `<at>Display Name</at>` with an `msteams.entities` mention whose `text`
   repeats that string. The ID is the UPN or Entra object ID, or the Teams
   user ID for a bot.
3. **Outlook email:** stop recommending the `mailto` anchor. Write `@Display
   Name` as plain text and tell the author to retype it as a mention in
   Outlook, by typing @ and picking the person, which also adds them to To.
   When the message is sent through Graph beta, set `mentions` and
   `toRecipients`. In both cases the body text is just `@Name`.
4. **No ID available:** keep the current fallback. Write the plain name and
   say that a real mention needs the ID.

## Limits

- Not tested: no message was sent to a live Teams or Exchange tenant.
- Whether Graph `chatMessage` accepts a UPN for `mentioned.user.id` is
  undocumented in the pages read.
- The behavior of the `OWAAM` anchor in current Outlook clients is known only
  from one 2022 forum thread.
- Slack's `<@USER_ID>` form was outside this question and was not re-checked.

## Preferred source repositories

These are agent-skill repositories, not Microsoft API documentation, so none
was expected to own a claim here. I code-searched each for mention-related
files at the revisions below before GitHub's search rate limit cut the check
short.

None of the checked repositories influenced the conclusion, which rests on
Microsoft's own documentation.
