# Security

Report vulnerabilities through [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/J03Fr0st/skills/security/advisories/new).
Include the affected skill or script, revision, reproduction, and impact. Remove
live credentials and private user content. Avoid public issues for unresolved
vulnerabilities.

Security fixes target the current `main` branch and the next release. Older
releases do not have separate maintenance branches; update to the latest fixed
revision when a fix is available.

Skills are instructions executed by an agent with the user's tools and
permissions. Review installed skills and scripts, use least-privilege tool
access, and treat retrieved content as untrusted input. Report misleading
permission claims, unintended destructive operations, prompt injection that
crosses a trust boundary, and credential exposure as security issues.
